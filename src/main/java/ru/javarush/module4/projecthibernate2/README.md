# MovieDBApp v.0.1b

A program for working with the movie database and its ecosystem for the movie rental business (stores, staff, customers, payments).

MovieDB Improvement suggestions:
-add a many-to-many relation to the special_features column in the Film table and make it String type;
-in the rating field of the Film table, remove the dashes in the rating name. For convenient work with mapping tables in Java;
-automate rating generation in the rental_rate column of the Film table.
